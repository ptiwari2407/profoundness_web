      "question": "How do you choose your client?",
      "answer": "“Those who lack courage, will always find a way a philosophy to justify it. - Albert Camus”\n\nThere is only one criterion, I use to assess my prospective client with. I ask myself following question:\nDoes my prospective client, really want to make a change in their life or do they keep finding reasons for not trying something new? \n\nDo they believe in the sacredness of their own being, and are willing to do the work? Or are they hoping, that I will give them a magic pill or exercise, psychedelics or tantra, that will solve their issues?  \n\nMy work is all about active engagement, and personal involvement, and if my prospective client would keep finding reason or philosophy to not do the work, that client is not for me. They should keep doing what they are doing, keep looking further for the next dopamine hit."
